Notes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Amendments to Iowa's child labor laws were signed by Governor Reynolds in May 2023. Changes relating to agricultural work include: 14-15 year olds can work 6 hours per day during the school week and work permits are no longer required. Children under 14 are now prohibited from doing any type of work, including migrant children who could previously work with a permit from the age of 12.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"In 2022, Governor Murphy signed amendments to New Jersey's child labor laws. School authority was withdrawn from the work permit registration process, and for children in agriculture the law was improved to require a work permit for all minors below 18 years. All minors must register for work on a state database, which requires parental consent.",,,,,,,"In January 2023, Oregon introduced a new law which states that agricultural employers must pay overtime after 55 hours are worked in a week. However, this law does not apply to migrant hand harvest workers 16 or younger who are paid the same piece rate as workers over 16.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Notes,,,,,,*Colorado state guidance does not reference this exemption and gives hours limitations of 3 per day/18 per week.,"Connecticut's agricultural child labor laws are in the state codes for agriculture, not for child labor. It is unclear if any of the child labor laws apply to agriculture, and the Connecticut Department of Labor failed to respond to repeated requests for clarification. 
*Although Connecticut requires an agricultural work permit, this does NOT require parental consent. However, the minimum age for work in agriculture is 14. Connecticut also has compulsory education until the age of 18, unless the child has already graduated high school.
**Connecticut state law exempts farms which have an average number of employees of fifteen or fewer in a week.
***Connecticut state law does not legislate for hazardous agricultural child labor, therefore the ages given here are for the minimum ages for any agricultural work. ","Delaware defaults to the FLSA other than an explicit exemption for hazardous work, which children can do if there is adult supervision. ",,"Telephone guidance from Florida state suggests that the minimum age exemption for livestock only applies to livestock on a family farm. However, the law explicitly states: Minors of any age may be employed: In domestic or farm work in connection with their own homes or the farm or ranch on which they live, or directly for their own parents or guardian, or in the herding, tending, and management of livestock, during the hours they are not required by law to be in school.",,,"Telephone guidance from Idaho state suggests that Idaho defaults to the FLSA, as agriculture is not explicitly mentioned in its state child labor laws, which predate the FLSA. However, other sources including the US DoL cite the Idaho state laws as applicable to agriculture.","Illinois state law only legislates for minimum ages to work in agriculture, therefore the FLSA applies to hours and hazardous work. ",,"Iowa state law prevents children from working in agriculture when school is in session. Guidance from the state suggests that this is because there is limited agricultural work children can do during these periods, but children who work for their parents in agriculture are exempt from this rule. ",,"Kentucky state law has been widely interpreted to exclude agricultural child labor. However, the law reads: “Gainful occupation” does not include employment in farm work or in domestic service in a private
home, nor occasional employment..."", which could be interpreted to mean it is only exempt when conducted in a private home.",,*Maine state law allows the local superintendent of schools to exempt child agricultural workers from maximum hours in accordance with the policy established by the Commissioner of Education and the Director of the Bureau of Labor Standards.,,,Michigan only legislates for cornseed production and agricultural processing. All other farmwork defaults to the FLSA.,,,Missouri state law allows children aged 12 to do 'occasional farm work' with parental consent.,,,"*Nevada bans children under 16 from working in tobacco warehouses and factories, but not from working on tobacco farms.",,New Jersey state law includes a clause that no minor can work more than 10 hours per day. State law does not define hazardous occupations therefore the information above is from the FLSA.,"New Mexico state does not legislate for hazardous work in agriculture, therefore this defaults to the FLSA. Telephone guidance from New Mexico state suggests that state laws do not apply to child labor in agriculture; however, other sources including the US DoL and farmers' associations cite the New Mexico state laws as applicable to agriculture.","*Very small farms are exempt (total wage bill $3000 p/a, which is lower than the threshold for exemption from the FLSA)",,North Dakota state guidance advises that the FLSA should apply where it is stronger than state laws.,,,"Oregon has specifically legislated to enable 9 year olds to participate in hand harvest without, debatably, breaching the FLSA, by only allowing their produce to be sold within Oregon state. In addition, Oregon state law on agricultural work has some significant exemptions to the rules stated above. a) Children can be exempted from maximum hours limits by request of a special permit. b) In non-harvest season, children under the age of 16 who are using power-driven machinery can only work 18 hours (instead of 25) when school is in session, and 44 hours (instead of 60) during vacations. However, special permits can be requested to eradicate these limits. ","Pennsylvania child labor laws exempt almost all agricultural work and guidance from the state suggests they default to the FLSA. However, seasonal agricultural child labor is governed by different legislation, which states that the minimum age is 14 and prevents children working between 7 AM and 1 hour after the end of the school day. It also states that children are subject to the state's child labor laws; however, this predates the child labor exemption for agriculture.","Children under 16 are banned from ""stripping, assorting, manufacturing or packing tobacco"".","South Carolina state law prohibits the Director from creating any regulations which are ""more restrictive or burdensome than applicable federal laws or regulations"". As such, the information given above is from the FLSA. However, the South Carolina Office of Wages and Child Labor website guidance suggests that agriculture is not exempt from the 3/18 and 8/40 hours limitations.",,,"Although Texas state guidance is that child labor in agriculture defaults to the FLSA, it also suggests that state law does apply to children during school hours, which would make the minimum age to work during school hours on a family farm 16.",,,"Virginia state law has a clause which prevents all minors being exposed to a recognized hazard capable of causing serious physical harm or death, but there is no definition of such hazards.","Washington state law prohibits 16-17 year olds from some hazardous work which the FLSA permits for 16 year olds, including working with and around pesticides.",*West Virginia state law suggests that minors under 14 cannot undertake hazardous agricultural work as defined by the US Labor Secretary.,,
